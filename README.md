## vue-token-authentication-


The zip file contains two sub files namely:
-vue-jwt-auth-app (This is the vue app for the frontend)
-vue-jwt-auth-server (This is the server built with node)

You will need to extract the app files to any location of choice toget the project ready for running.

### Steps
Generally, you would have to do `npm install` to install project dependencies for both the vue and express files.

Next:
1. To start the vue project, run `npm run dev` to get the server running

2. To start the node/express, run `npm start` to get the server running. Ensure you have `nodemon` installed on you machine!
